# RTS Balancing
I am Guillem Sánchez, student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).
In this Website i'm gonna explain how works the balance of units and some other stuff in RTS videogames like Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, Ensemble Studios or Praetorians, Pyro Studios.

But, What is the meaning of balancing a game?

For me, balancing a game means that any of the game elements are inefective or undesirable to play with or againts.

"An important trait of any game is the illusion of winnability. If a game is to provide a continuing challenge to players, it must also provide a continuing motivation to play. The game must appear to be winnable to all players, beginners and experts, but it must never truly be winnable or it will lose its appeal."
