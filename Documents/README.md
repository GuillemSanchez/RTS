# RTS Balancing
I am Guillem Sánchez, student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).
In this Website i'm gonna explain how works the balance of units and some other stuff in RTS videogames like Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, Ensemble Studios or Praetorians, Pyro Studios.

But, What is balancing in a game?

For me, balancing a game means that any of the game elements are inefective or undesirable to play with or againts.

"An important trait of any game is the illusion of winnability. If a game is to provide a continuing challenge to players, it must also provide a continuing motivation to play. The game must appear to be winnable to all players, beginners and experts, but it must never truly be winnable or it will lose its appeal."

## Unit Balancing

Now we barely know what is balencing a game, but was is the meaning of this?
Whould you rather play a game that allows this?

Its a bit extremly, but this is NOT fun, we want to avoid this in our games, that is why Units are one of the core components of any RTS video game. It is important to have a balanced roster of units. Without a good unit balance, the game would be like a farming simulation with some types of units that can destroy the rival farm.

### Visible vs Hidden Balancing

There are 2 main types of unit balancing, the first one is the visible, this type is balancing that can be directly seen by the player, range of a shot, speed of a unit or type of movement (ground unit, sea unit, flying unit).

The second type of unit balancing is hidden balancing, This kind of balancing is used in the games rules, changing probabilities for events or efficiencies of abilities. Examples of abstract balancing are stats like health, damages, crit. Hidden balancing is usually presented to the player through text labels in the UI (user interface).
